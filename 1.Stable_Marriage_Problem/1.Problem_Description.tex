\section{Stable marriage problem}\label{stable-marriage-problem}

The stable marriage problem is the problem of finding a stable matching
between two \textbf{equally} sized sets of elements given an ordering of
preferences for each element.

The SMP has been stated as follows:

\begin{verbatim}
Given n men and n women, where each person has ranked all men in the order of
preferences, marry the men and women together such that there are no two
people of opposite sex who both rather have each other then their current
partners. When there are no such pairs of people, the set of marriages is
deemed stable.  
\end{verbatim}

Initialize all m \epsilon  M and w \epsilon  W to free

\begin{verbatim}
While \exists free man m who still has a women w to propose to {
    
    w = first women on m's list to whom m has not yet proposed

    if w is free:
        (m,w) become engaged

        else some pair (m' , w) already exitsts

            if w prefers m to m'

            (m,w) become engaged
                else 
                (m', w) remain egaged

} 
\end{verbatim}

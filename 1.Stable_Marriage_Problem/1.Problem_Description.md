# Stable marriage problem
The stable marriage problem is the problem of finding a stable matching between
two __equally__ sized sets of elements given an ordering of preferences for
each element.

The SMP has been stated as follows:
``` 
Given n men and n women, where each person has ranked all men in the order of
preferences, marry the men and women together such that there are no two
people of opposite sex who both rather have each other then their current
partners. When there are no such pairs of people, the set of marriages is
deemed stable.  
``` 

## Applications include:
1. assign graduating medical students to first hospital appointments. 

## The Gale-Shapley algorithm (2012 Nobel Prize in Economics)

Initialize all m \epsilon M and w \epsilon W to free

    __While__ \exists free man m who still has a women w to propose to {
    
    
    
    
    }
